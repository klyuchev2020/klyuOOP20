Here we input shape collection.
Each the shape description holds single line with format:
For Segment Line: "SegmentLine  first_point_x first_point_y second_point_x second_point_y outline_color"
For Circle:  "Circle center_x center_y radius outline_color fill_color"
For Triangle: "Triangle first_vertex_x first_vertex_y second_vertex_x second_vertex_y third_vertex_x third_vertex_y outline_color fill_color"
For Rectangle: "Rectangle left_top_vertex_x left_top_vertex_y width height outline_color fill_color"
